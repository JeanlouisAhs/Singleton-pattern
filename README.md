# Singleton-pattern
This is some examples of Singleton pattern implementation in Java

In this projects we implement three examples of singleton pattern.

We have three packages :

## Banque

Here we can create an account and do some operations .This operations must be write in the **Journal**. So we must have only one instance of the object who manage the journal.And to add more fun one file is attach to this journal, and we also use singleton pattern to have only one instance of the file object when the program is running

# #Database

In database implementation we must have one instance of database connexion and here we implement this with singleton pattern

##SingleObject 

It's just an trivial and direct implementation of Singleton pattern
